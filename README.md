Snipey_McSniperson

Snipey™ is a modular, CLI-driven crypto intelligence bot designed for high-trust environments and deterministic automation. Built under the Archer Family Trust, it serves as a resilient safety net for traders navigating volatile markets and fragmented workflows.

Key Features:

Zero-trust architecture with isolated modules and explicit authentication boundaries

Composable scrapers for real-time data ingestion across exchanges, tickers, and sentiment feeds

Flow-based orchestration optimized for Termux and low-footprint environments Carpentry logic applied to repo structure: measure, cut, fit, test, adjust, repeat

Storage-aware design for mobile deployment and reproducibility across devices

Purpose:

Snipey exists to protect, clarify, and stabilize especially for those who never had a safety net. It's not just a bot. It's a legacy artifact.
